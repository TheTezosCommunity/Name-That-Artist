3. **Click fast** once you're confident

### Learn the Artists
- Pay attention to artist addresses throughout games
- Check out the NFTs on objkt.com after games
- Recognize patterns in art styles
- Build familiarity with TTC wallet artists

### Compete Fairly
- No external tools or lookups during rounds
- Play honestly for the community
- Celebrate others' wins
- Have fun learning about Tezos artists!

## NFT Data Source

All NFTs are fetched from **The Tezos Community wallet**:
- Wallet: `tz1RZN17j7FuPtDpGpXKgMXbx57WEhpZGF6B`
- Source: objkt.com GraphQL API
- Cache: Refreshed every 24 hours
- Images: Displayed via IPFS gateway

## Troubleshooting

### "Not enough tokens to start a game"
The bot needs at least 10 NFTs in the wallet. If you see this, wait for the token cache to refresh or contact an admin.

### "A game is already in progress"
Only one game per channel at a time. Wait for it to finish or use `/stopgame` (if you're the starter or moderator).

### "You have already answered this round"
You can only answer once per round. Your first click is final!

### Bot is slow on first run
The first time the bot starts, it fetches all NFTs from the TTC wallet. This takes 1-2 minutes. Subsequent runs use cached data and start instantly.

### Buttons don't work
Make sure the bot has proper permissions:
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Use Application Commands
- Read Message History

## Data & Privacy

### What's Stored
- Your Discord user ID and username
- Your game scores and win/loss record
- Game history (last 50 games)

### What's NOT Stored
- Messages or chat history
- Personal information
- Voice or video data

### Data Location
All data is stored locally in JSON files on the bot server. No external database or third-party services (except objkt.com for NFT data).
