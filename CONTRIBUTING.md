## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use ES6+ features (async/await, arrow functions, etc.)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns in the project

### Adding New Commands

1. **Define the command** in `deploy-commands.js`:
   ```javascript
   {
       name: 'mycommand',
       description: 'Description of what the command does',
   }
   ```

2. **Add the handler** in `index.js` under the `InteractionCreate` event:
   ```javascript
   if (commandName === 'mycommand') {
       await interaction.reply({
           content: 'Command response',
           ephemeral: false // or true for private responses
       });
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy the command**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy-commands
   ```

### Adding Game Features

Game logic lives in `game.js`. The `NameThatArtistGame` class manages:
- Active game sessions
- Artist data
- Game state
- Hint system

Example of adding a new game method:

```javascript
// In game.js
export class NameThatArtistGame {
    // ... existing methods ...
    
    myNewFeature(channelId) {
        const session = this.activeSessions.get(channelId);
        if (!session) {
            return { success: false, message: 'No active game' };
        }
        
        // Your logic here
        return { success: true, /* your data */ };
    }
}
```

### Adding Artist Data

To add Tezos artists to the game:

1. Open `game.js`
2. Add artist objects to `SAMPLE_ARTISTS`:

```javascript
const SAMPLE_ARTISTS = [
    {
        name: 'Artist Name',
        artworks: [
            'https://url-to-artwork.jpg',
            // Add more artwork URLs
        ],
        bio: 'Brief description of the artist'
    },
    // Add more artists...
];
```

**Important**: Ensure you have permission to use the artwork URLs and artist information.

## Testing Your Changes

1. Run the bot locally: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
2. Test in a private Discord server
3. Try all relevant commands
4. Check for error messages in the console
5. Verify the bot responds appropriately

### Test Checklist
