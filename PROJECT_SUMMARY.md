## 📝 Next Steps

### To Make It Production-Ready:

1. **Add Real Artist Data**
   - Open `game.js`
   - Replace `SAMPLE_ARTISTS` with real Tezos artist data
   - Use the format shown in `examples/artists-example.js`

2. **Get Discord Credentials**
   - Create a Discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Copy your bot token and client ID
   - Add them to `.env` file

3. **Deploy Commands**
   - Run `npm run deploy-commands`
   - This registers slash commands with Discord

4. **Invite Bot to Server**
   - Use the OAuth2 URL Generator in Discord Developer Portal
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Select permissions: Send Messages, Embed Links, etc.

5. **Test the Bot**
   - Start with `npm start`
   - Try `/help` command
   - Start a game with `/namethatartist`
