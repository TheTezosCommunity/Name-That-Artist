Dependencies:

└── dotenv@16.6.1              # Environment variables
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure bot (edit .env with your Discord credentials)
cp .env.example .env
# Add your DISCORD_TOKEN and CLIENT_ID

# Deploy slash commands to Discord
npm run deploy-commands

# Start the bot (will auto-fetch NFT data on first run)
npm start

# Or run in development mode (auto-restart)
npm run dev
```

**Note**: On first run, the bot will fetch all NFTs from the TTC wallet via objkt.com API. This takes 1-2 minutes. Subsequent runs will use cached data.

## 🎮 Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/namethatartist` | Start a new game (10 rounds of NFT trivia) |
| `/leaderboard` | View top 10 players by total score |
| `/stats` | View your personal statistics |
| `/stopgame` | Stop the current game (starter or moderator only) |
| `/ping` | Check bot responsiveness |
| `/help` | Display help information |

## 🔧 Technology Stack

## 📝 Next Steps

### To Make It Production-Ready:

1. **Get Discord Credentials**
   - Create a Discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Copy your bot token and client ID
   - Add them to `.env` file

2. **Deploy Commands**

4. **Start the Bot**
   - Run `npm start`
   - Bot will automatically fetch NFT data from TTC wallet (first run only)
