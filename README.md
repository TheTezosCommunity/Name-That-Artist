## 🎨 About TTC

This bot is created for **The Tezos Community (TTC)**, celebrating the vibrant art scene on the Tezos blockchain. The game fetches NFTs from the TTC community wallet (`tz1RZN17j7FuPtDpGpXKgMXbx57WEhpZGF6B`) and helps members discover and appreciate the talented artists in the ecosystem.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Bot fetches NFT tokens from the TTC wallet via objkt.com GraphQL API
2. **Token Caching**: Stores tokens locally for 24 hours to reduce API calls
3. **Game Start**: Player initiates a game with `/namethatartist`
4. **Rounds**: Each game has 10 rounds with random NFTs
5. **Multiple Choice**: Each round shows 4 artist options (1 correct, 3 distractors)
6. **Timed Answers**: Players have 15 seconds to click the correct button
7. **Scoring**: Points = 100 × (time_remaining / total_time)
8. **Leaderboard**: Scores are saved and tracked across games
